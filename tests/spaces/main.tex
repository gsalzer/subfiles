\begin{document}
The \verb|\subfile| command behaves like the \verb|\input| command:
one space stems from the space after the command, one space from the
end of the text in the subfile.  \medskip

Included via subfile:

\subfile{s1}
\subfile{s1}\subfile{s1}

\medskip

Included via input:

\input{s2}
\input{s2}\input{s2}
\bigskip

Now the extra space in the subfile has been removed.

\subfile{s3}
\subfile{s3}\subfile{s3}
\bigskip

Now there are extra lines after \verb|\end{document}| in the subfile.
In version 2.0 and later, they are ignored and should not introduce line breaks.
With the \texttt{v1} option, however, there should be linebreaks.

\subfile{s4}
\subfile{s4}\subfile{s4}
\end{document}
