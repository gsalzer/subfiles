Here, we are testing two things. First, spreading the files across
different directories and generating the bibliography with
\verb|bibtex| used to be a problem. Let's hope that it is not anymore.
Second, the \verb|bibentry| package defines commands that give an
error when used in the preamble. For this they check whether the
\verb|\document| command has a specific value. In older versions of
\verb|subfiles| they found the wrong value and complained, even though
they were correctly used.
